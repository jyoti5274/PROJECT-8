Recommender (Build intelligence to help customers discover products they may like and most likely purchase)
Build intelligence to help customers discover products they may like and most likely purchase


1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Download the provided dataset (Recommnder.zip).
This dataset likely includes information about products, customers, purchases, and browsing behavior.
Use libraries like Pandas to explore and clean the data. Handle missing values, inconsistencies, and format data appropriately.
Consider creating additional features like product categories, user demographics, or purchase frequency.

2. Recommendation Techniques:

Collaborative Filtering (CF): This technique recommends products similar to what other users with similar purchase history have liked.
Implement algorithms like Matrix Factorization using libraries like scikit-learn Surprise.
Content-Based Filtering (CBF): This recommends products with similar features to what the user has previously purchased or browsed.
Analyze product features like brand, category, price, etc. Use techniques like TF-IDF for item similarity.

3. Hybrid Models:

Combine CF and CBF to leverage user-item interactions and product features for more robust recommendations.
Weighted approaches can prioritize user preferences or product attributes based on the scenario.

4. Evaluation Metrics:

Implement metrics like:
Precision: Ratio of correctly recommended items to all recommendations.
Recall: Ratio of correctly recommended items to all relevant items the user might like.
F1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Mean Average Precision (MAP): Average of precision at all retrieval positions.
Use libraries like scikit-learn metrics to calculate these scores.
Evaluate the performance of each model (CF, CBF, and Hybrid) and choose the one with the highest accuracy and relevance.

5. Deliverables:


Report: Create a PDF report detailing:
System design and architecture (data flow, models used).
Description of recommendation techniques and their benefits.
Evaluation metrics used and achieved performance.
Benefits for the e-commerce organization (increased sales, customer satisfaction).
